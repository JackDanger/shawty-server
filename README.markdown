# Shawty


Shawty is the simplest Ruby url-shortening app ever. Run your own server that works like [tinyurl.com](tinyurl.com).


## What you need to get this running

* Clone this: `git clone git://github.com/JackDanger/shawty-server.git`
* Signup for an account at Heroku ([better details here](http://github.com/sinatra/heroku-sinatra-app))
* push this to Heroku.com: `git push heroku master`
* Revel.


## Why?

If you run any application with published content it's helpful to have shorter links to that content.

Consider that your Rails app might offer pages like the following:

    http://myapp.com/accounts/megacorp/invoices?single_access_token=5ASD32ADf89JKASF2346

Imagine trying to fit that in a text message. Instead, how about:

    http://url.myapp.com/a7D

Way groovy.
